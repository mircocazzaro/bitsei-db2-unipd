"11","Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and HuntingT","The Sector as a Whole

The Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in growing crops, raising animals, harvesting timber, and harvesting fish and other animals from a farm, ranch, or their natural habitats.

The establishments in this sector are often described as farms, ranches, dairies, greenhouses, nurseries, orchards, or hatcheries.  A farm may consist of a single tract of land or a number of separate tracts which may be held under different tenures.  For example, one tract may be owned by the farm operator and another rented.  It may be operated by the operator alone or with the assistance of members of the household or hired employees, or it may be operated by a partnership, corporation, or other type of organization. When a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, croppers, or managers, the land operated by each is considered a farm.

The sector distinguishes two basic activities: agricultural production and agricultural support activities.  Agricultural production includes establishments performing the complete farm or ranch operation, such as farm owner-operators and tenant farm operators.  Agricultural support activities include establishments that perform one or more activities associated with farm operation, such as soil preparation, planting, harvesting, and management, on a contract or fee basis.

Excluded from the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting sector are establishments primarily engaged in agricultural research (e.g., experimental farms) and government establishments primarily engaged in administering programs for regulating and conserving land, mineral, wildlife, and forest use.  These establishments are classified in Industry 54171, Research and Development in the Physical, Engineering, and Life Sciences; and Industry 92412, Administration of Conservation Programs, respectively.
"
"111","Crop ProductionT","Industries in the Crop Production subsector grow crops mainly for food and fiber.  The subsector comprises establishments, such as farms, orchards, groves, greenhouses, and nurseries, primarily engaged in growing crops, plants, vines, or trees and their seeds.

The industries in this subsector are grouped by similarity of production activity, including biological and physiological characteristics and economic requirements, the length of growing season, degree of crop rotation, extent of input specialization, labor requirements, and capital demands.  The production process is typically completed when the raw product or commodity grown reaches the ""farm gate"" for market, that is, at the point of first sale or price determination.

Establishments are classified in the Crop Production subsector when crop production (i.e., value of crops for market) accounts for one-half or more of the establishment's total agricultural production.  Within the subsector, establishments are classified in a specific industry when a product or industry family of products (i.e., oilseed and grain farming, vegetable and melon farming, fruit and tree nut farming) account for one-half or more of the establishment's agricultural production.  Establishments with one-half or more crop production with no one product or family of products of an industry accounting for one-half of the establishment's agricultural production are treated as general combination crop farming and are classified in Industry 11199, All Other Crop Farming.

Industries in the Crop Production subsector include establishments that own, operate, and manage and those that operate and manage.  Those that manage only are classified in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and Forestry.  Establishments that raise aquatic plants in controlled or selected aquatic environments are classified in Subsector 112, Animal Production and Aquaculture.

"113","Forestry and LoggingT","Industries in the Forestry and Logging subsector grow and harvest timber on a long production cycle (i.e., of 10 years or more).  Long production cycles use different production processes than short production cycles, which require more horticultural interventions prior to harvest, resulting in processes more similar to those found in the Crop Production subsector.  Consequently, Christmas tree production and other production involving production cycles of less than 10 years, are classified in the Crop Production subsector.

Industries in this subsector specialize in different stages of the production cycle.  Reforestation requires production of seedlings in specialized nurseries.  Timber production requires natural forest or suitable areas of land that are available for a long duration.  The maturation time for timber depends upon the species of tree, the climatic conditions of the region, and the intended purpose of the timber.  The harvesting of timber (except when done on an extremely small scale) requires specialized machinery unique to the industry.  Establishments gathering forest products, such as gums, barks, balsam needles, rhizomes, fibers, Spanish moss, and ginseng and truffles, are also included in this subsector.

"21","Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas ExtractionT","The Sector as a Whole

The Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector comprises establishments that extract naturally occurring mineral solids, such as coal and ores; liquid minerals, such as crude petroleum; and gases, such as natural gas.  The term ""mining"" is used in the broad sense to include quarrying, well operations, beneficiating (e.g., crushing, screening, washing, and flotation), and other preparation customarily performed at the mine site, or as a part of mining activity.

The Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector distinguishes two basic activities: mine operation and mining support activities.  Mine operation includes establishments operating mines, quarries, or oil and gas wells on their own account or for others on a contract or fee basis.  Mining support activities include establishments that perform exploration (except geophysical surveying and mapping) on a contract or fee basis and/or other mining services on a contract or fee basis (except mine site preparation, construction, and transportation activities).

Establishments in the Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction sector are grouped and classified according to the natural resource mined or to be mined.  Industries include establishments that develop and/or operate the mine site, extract the natural resources, beneficiate (i.e., prepare) the mineral mined, or provide mining support activities.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  The operations that take place in beneficiation are primarily mechanical, such as grinding, washing, magnetic separation, and centrifugal separation.  In contrast, manufacturing operations primarily use chemical and electrochemical processes, such as electrolysis and distillation.  However, some treatments, such as heat treatments, take place in both the beneficiation and the manufacturing (i.e., smelting/refining) stages.  The range of preparation activities varies by mineral and the purity of any given ore deposit.  While some minerals, such as petroleum and natural gas, require little or no preparation, others are washed and screened, while yet others, such as gold and silver, can be transformed into bullion before leaving the mine site.

Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be collected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, and then beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals into more finished manufactured products are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products will be classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured product will be classified in Sector 31-33, Manufacturing.

"23","ConstructionT","The Sector as a Whole

The Construction sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in the construction of buildings or engineering projects (e.g., highways and utility systems).  Establishments primarily engaged in the preparation of sites for new construction and establishments primarily engaged in subdividing land for sale as building sites also are included in this sector.

Construction work done may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs.  Activities of these establishments generally are managed at a fixed place of business, but they usually perform construction activities at multiple project sites.  Production responsibilities for establishments in this sector are usually specified in (1) contracts with the owners of construction projects (prime contracts) or (2) contracts with other construction establishments (subcontracts).

Establishments primarily engaged in contracts that include responsibility for all aspects of individual construction projects are commonly known as general contractors, but also may be known as design-builders, construction managers, turnkey contractors, or (in cases where two or more establishments jointly secure a general contract) joint-venture contractors.  Construction managers that provide oversight and scheduling only (i.e., agency) as well as construction managers that are responsible for the entire project (i.e., at risk) are included as general contractor type establishments.  Establishments of the ""general contractor type"" frequently arrange construction of separate parts of their projects through subcontracts with other construction establishments.

Establishments primarily engaged in activities to produce a specific component (e.g., masonry, painting, and electrical work) of a construction project are commonly known as specialty trade contractors.  Activities of specialty trade contractors are usually subcontracted from other construction establishments, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, the work may be done directly for the owner of the property.

Establishments primarily engaged in activities to construct buildings to be sold on sites that they own are known as for-sale builders, but also may be known as speculative builders or merchant builders.  For-sale builders produce buildings in a manner similar to general contractors, but their production processes also include site acquisition and securing of financial backing.  For-sale builders are most often associated with the construction of residential buildings.  Like general contractors, they may subcontract all or part of the actual construction work on their buildings.

There are substantial differences in the types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by establishments in this sector.  To highlight these differences and variations in the underlying production functions, this sector is divided into three subsectors.

Subsector 236, Construction of Buildings, comprises establishments of the general contractor type and for-sale builders involved in the construction of buildings.  Subsector 237, Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction, comprises establishments involved in the construction of engineering projects.  Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors, comprises establishments engaged in specialty trade activities generally needed in the construction of all types of buildings.

Force account construction is construction work performed by an enterprise primarily engaged in some business other than construction for its own account, using employees of the enterprise.  This activity is not included in the construction sector unless the construction work performed is the primary activity of a separate establishment of the enterprise.  The installation and the ongoing repair and maintenance of telecommunications and utility networks is excluded from construction when the establishments performing the work are not independent contractors.  Although a growing proportion of this work is subcontracted to independent contractors in the Construction sector, the operating units of telecommunications and utility companies performing this work are included with the telecommunications or utility activities.

"237","Heavy and Civil Engineering ConstructionT","The Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is the construction of entire engineering projects (e.g., highways and dams), and specialty trade contractors, whose primary activity is the production of a specific component for such projects.  Specialty trade contractors in the Heavy and Civil Engineering Construction subsector generally are performing activities that are specific to heavy and civil engineering construction projects and are not normally performed on buildings.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, or maintenance and repairs. 

Specialty trade activities are classified in this subsector if the skills and equipment present are specific to heavy or civil engineering construction projects.  For example, specialized equipment is needed to paint lines on highways.  This equipment is not normally used in building applications so the activity is classified in this subsector.  Traffic signal installation, while specific to highways, uses much of the same skills and equipment that are needed for electrical work in building projects and is therefore classified in Subsector 238, Specialty Trade Contractors.

Construction projects involving water resources (e.g., dredging and land drainage) and projects involving open space improvement (e.g., parks and trails) are included in this subsector.  Establishments whose primary activity is the subdivision of land into individual building lots usually perform various additional site-improvement activities (e.g., road building and utility line installation) and are included in this subsector. 

Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the types of structures that they construct.  This classification reflects variations in the requirements of the underlying production processes.

"238","Specialty Trade ContractorsT","The Specialty Trade Contractors subsector comprises establishments whose primary activity is performing specific activities (e.g., pouring concrete, site preparation, plumbing, painting, and electrical work) involved in building construction or other activities that are similar for all types of construction, but that are not responsible for the entire project.  The work performed may include new work, additions, alterations, maintenance, and repairs.  The production work performed by establishments in this subsector is usually subcontracted from establishments of the general contractor type or for-sale builders, but especially in remodeling and repair construction, work also may be done directly for the owner of the property.  Specialty trade contractors usually perform most of their work at the construction site, although they may have shops where they perform prefabrication and other work.  Establishments primarily engaged in preparing sites for new construction are also included in this subsector.

There are substantial differences in types of equipment, work force skills, and other inputs required by specialty trade contractors.  Establishments in this subsector are classified based on the underlying production function for the specialty trade in which they specialize.  Throughout the Specialty Trade Contractors subsector, establishments commonly provide both the parts and labor required to complete work.  For example, electrical contractors supply the current-carrying and noncurrent-carrying wiring devices that are required to install a circuit.  Plumbing, heating, and air-conditioning contractors also supply the parts required to complete a contract.

"31-33","ManufacturingT","The Sector as a Whole

The Manufacturing sector comprises establishments engaged in the mechanical, physical, or chemical transformation of materials, substances, or components into new products.  The assembling of component parts of manufactured products is considered manufacturing, except in cases where the activity is appropriately classified in Sector 23, Construction.

Establishments in the Manufacturing sector are often described as plants, factories, or mills and characteristically use power-driven machines and material handling equipment.  However, establishments that transform materials or substances into new products by hand or in the worker's home and those engaged in selling to the general public products made on the same premises from which they are sold, such as bakeries, candy stores, and custom tailors, may also be included in this sector.  Manufacturing establishments may process materials or may contract with other establishments to process their materials for them.  Both types of establishments are included in manufacturing.  Selected industries in the Manufacturing sector are comprised solely of establishments that process materials for other establishments on a contract or fee basis.  Beyond these dedicated contract manufacturing industries, establishments that process materials for other establishments are generally classified in the Manufacturing industry of the processed materials.

The materials, substances, or components transformed by manufacturing establishments are raw materials that are products of agriculture, forestry, fishing, mining, or quarrying as well as products of other manufacturing establishments.  The materials used may be purchased directly from producers, obtained through customary trade channels, or secured without recourse to the market by transferring the product from one establishment to another, under the same ownership.

The new product of a manufacturing establishment may be finished in the sense that it is ready for utilization or consumption, or it may be semi-finished to become an input for an establishment engaged in further manufacturing.  For example, the product of the alumina refinery is the input used in the primary production of aluminum; primary aluminum is the input to an aluminum wire drawing plant; and aluminum wire is the input for a fabricated wire product manufacturing establishment.

The subsectors in the Manufacturing sector generally reflect distinct production processes related to material inputs, production equipment, and employee skills.  In the machinery area, where assembling is a key activity, parts and accessories for manufactured products are classified in the industry of the finished manufactured item when they are made for separate sale.  For example, an attachment for a piece of metalworking machinery would be classified with metalworking machinery.  However, component inputs from other manufacturing establishments are classified based on the production function of the component manufacturer.  For example, electronic components are classified in Subsector 334, Computer and Electronic Product Manufacturing, and stampings are classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.

Manufacturing establishments often perform one or more activities that are classified outside the Manufacturing sector of NAICS.  For instance, almost all manufacturing has some captive research and development or administrative operations, such as accounting, payroll, or management.  These captive services are treated the same as captive manufacturing activities.  When the services are provided by separate establishments, they are classified in the NAICS sector where such services are primary, not in manufacturing. 

The boundaries of manufacturing and the other sectors of the classification system can be somewhat blurry.  The establishments in the Manufacturing sector are engaged in the transformation of materials into new products.  Their output is a new product.  However, the definition of what constitutes a new product can be somewhat subjective.  As clarification, the following activities are considered manufacturing in NAICS:

Conversely, there are activities that are sometimes considered manufacturing, but which for NAICS are classified in another sector (i.e., not classified as manufacturing). They include:

1. Logging, classified in Sector 11, Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing and Hunting, is considered a harvesting operation;
2. Beneficiating ores and other minerals, classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction, is considered part of the activity of mining;
3. Constructing structures, assembling prefabricated buildings, and fabricating at the construction site by contractors are classified in Sector 23, Construction;
4. Breaking bulk and reselling in smaller lots, including packaging, repackaging, or bottling products, such as liquors or chemicals; assembling and selling computers on a custom basis; sorting and reselling scrap; mixing and selling paints to customer order; and cutting metals to customer order for resale are classified in Sector 42, Wholesale Trade, or Sector 44-45, Retail Trade; and
5. Publishing and the combined activity of publishing and printing, classified in Sector 51, Information, transform information into a product for which the value to the consumer lies in the information content, not in the format in which it is distributed (i.e., the book or software compact disc).

"313","Textile MillsT","Industries in the Textile Mills subsector group establishments that transform a basic fiber (natural or synthetic) into a product, such as yarn or fabric that is further manufactured into usable items, such as apparel, sheets, towels, and textile bags for individual or industrial consumption.  The further manufacturing may be performed in the same establishment and classified in this subsector, or it may be performed at a separate establishment and be classified elsewhere in the Manufacturing sector.

The main processes in this subsector include preparation and spinning of fiber, knitting or weaving of fabric, and the finishing of the textile.  The NAICS structure follows and captures this process flow.  Major industries in this flow, such as preparation of fibers, weaving of fabric, knitting of fabric, and fiber and fabric finishing, are uniquely identified.  Texturizing, throwing, twisting, and winding of yarn contain aspects of both fiber preparation and fiber finishing and are classified with preparation of fibers rather than with finishing of fibers.

NAICS separates the manufacturing of primary textiles and the manufacturing of textile products (except apparel) produced from purchased primary textiles, such as fabric.  The manufacturing of textile products (except apparel) from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 314, Textile Product Mills, and apparel from purchased fabric is classified in Subsector 315, Apparel Manufacturing.

"322","Paper ManufacturingT","Industries in the Paper Manufacturing subsector make pulp, paper, or converted paper products.  The manufacturing of these products is grouped together because they constitute a series of vertically connected processes.  More than one is often carried out in a single establishment.  There are essentially three activities.  The manufacturing of pulp involves separating the cellulose fibers from other impurities in wood or used paper.  The manufacturing of paper involves matting these fibers into a sheet.  The manufacturing of converted paper products involves converting paper and other materials by various cutting and shaping techniques and includes coating and laminating activities.

The Paper Manufacturing subsector is subdivided into two industry groups, the first for the manufacturing of pulp and paper and the second for the manufacturing of converted paper products.  Paper making is treated as the core activity of the subsector.  Therefore, any establishment that makes paper (including paperboard), either alone or in combination with pulp manufacturing or paper converting, is classified as a paper or paperboard mill.  Establishments that make pulp without making paper are classified as pulp mills.  Pulp mills, paper mills, and paperboard mills comprise the first industry group.

Establishments that make products from purchased paper and other materials make up the second industry group, Converted Paper Product Manufacturing.  This general activity is then subdivided based, for the most part, on process distinctions.  Paperboard container manufacturing uses corrugating, cutting, and shaping machinery to form paperboard into containers.  Paper bag and coated and treated paper manufacturing establishments cut and coat paper and foil.  Stationery product manufacturing establishments make a variety of paper products used for writing, filing, and similar applications.  Other converted paper product manufacturing includes, in particular, the conversion of sanitary paper stock into such things as tissue paper and disposable diapers.

An important process used in the Paper Bag and Coated and Treated Paper Manufacturing industry is lamination, often combined with coating.  Lamination and coating make a composite material with improved properties of strength, impermeability, and so on.  The laminated materials may be paper, metal foil, or plastics film.  While paper is often one of the components, it is not always.  Lamination of plastics film to plastics film is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing, because establishments that do this often first make the film.  The same situation holds with respect to bags.  The manufacturing of bags from plastics only, whether or not laminated, is classified in Subsector 326, Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing.

Excluded from this subsector are photosensitive papers.  These papers are chemically treated and are classified in Industry 32599, All Other Chemical Product and Preparation Manufacturing.

"323","Printing and Related Support ActivitiesT","Industries in the Printing and Related Support Activities subsector print products, such as newspapers, books, labels, business cards, stationery, business forms, and other materials, and perform support activities, such as data imaging, platemaking services, and bookbinding.  The support activities included here are an integral part of the printing industry, and a product (a printing plate, a bound book, or a computer disk or file) that is an integral part of the printing industry is almost always provided by these operations.

Processes used in printing include a variety of methods used to transfer an image from a plate, screen, film, or computer file to some medium, such as paper, plastics, metal, textile articles, or wood.  The printing processes employed include, but are not limited to, lithographic, gravure, screen, flexographic, digital, and letterpress.

In contrast to many other classification systems that locate publishing of printed materials in manufacturing, NAICS classifies the publishing of printed products in Subsector 513, Publishing Industries.  Though printing and publishing are often carried out by the same enterprise, it is less and less the case that these distinct activities are carried out in the same establishment.  When publishing and printing are done in the same establishment, the establishment is classified in Subsector 513, Publishing Industries, in the appropriate NAICS industry even if the receipts for printing exceed those for publishing.

This subsector includes printing on clothing because the production process for that activity is printing, not clothing manufacturing.  For instance, the printing of T-shirts is included in this subsector.  In contrast, printing on fabric (or grey goods) is not included.  This activity is part of the process of finishing the fabric and is included in Industry 31331, Textile and Fabric Finishing Mills.

Excluded from this subsector are establishment primarily engaged in manufacturing bare printed circuit boards.  These establishments print, perforate, plate, screen, etch, or photoprint interconnecting pathways for electric current on laminates and are classified in Industry 33441, Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing.  Establishments primarily providing printing brokerage services are classified in Industry 56199, All Other Support Services.

"326","Plastics and Rubber Products ManufacturingT","Industries in the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector make goods by processing plastics materials and raw rubber.  The core technology employed by establishments in this subsector is that of plastics or rubber product production.  Plastics and rubber are combined in the same subsector because plastics are increasingly being used as a substitute for rubber; however, the subsector is generally restricted to the production of products made of just one material, either solely plastics or rubber.

Many manufacturing activities use plastics or rubber, for example the manufacture of footwear or furniture.  Typically, the production process of these products involves more than one material.  In these cases, technologies that allow disparate materials to be formed and combined are of central importance in describing the manufacturing activity.  In NAICS, such activities (footwear and furniture manufacturing) are not classified in the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector because the core technologies for these activities are diverse and involve multiple materials.

Within the Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing subsector, a distinction is made between plastics and rubber products at the industry group level, although it is not a rigid distinction, as can be seen from the definition of Industry 32622, Rubber and Plastics Hoses and Belting Manufacturing.  In the case of hoses and belting, plastics are used as a substitute for rubber, and the distinction in materials is not useful as a basis for establishment classification.

In keeping with the core technology focus of plastics, lamination of plastics film to plastics film as well as the production of bags from plastics only is classified in this subsector.  Lamination and bag production involving plastics and materials other than plastics are classified in Subsector 322, Paper Manufacturing.

"327","Nonmetallic Mineral Product ManufacturingT","The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector is based on the transformation of mined or quarried nonmetallic minerals, such as sand, gravel, stone, clay, and refractory materials, into products for intermediate or final consumption.  Processes used include grinding, mixing, cutting, shaping, and honing.  Heat often is used in the process and chemicals are frequently mixed to change the composition, purity, and chemical properties for the intended product.  For example, glass is produced by heating silica sand to the melting point (sometimes combined with cullet or recycled glass) and then drawn, floated, or blow molded to the desired shape or thickness.  Refractory materials are heated and then formed into bricks or other shapes for use in industrial applications.

The Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector includes establishments that manufacture bricks, refractories, ceramic products, and glass and glass products, such as plate glass and containers.  Also included are cement and concrete products, lime, gypsum, and other nonmetallic mineral products including abrasive products, ceramic plumbing fixtures, statuary, cut stone products, and mineral wool.  The products are used in a wide range of activities from construction and heavy and light manufacturing to articles for personal use.

Mining, beneficiating, and manufacturing activities often occur in a single location.  Separate receipts will be collected for these activities whenever possible.  When receipts cannot be broken out between mining and manufacturing, establishments that mine or quarry nonmetallic minerals, beneficiate the nonmetallic minerals, and further process the nonmetallic minerals into a more finished manufactured product are classified based on the primary activity of the establishment.  A mine that manufactures a small amount of finished products is classified in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.  An establishment that mines whose primary output is a more finished manufactured product is classified in the Manufacturing sector.

Excluded from the Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing subsector are establishments that primarily beneficiate mined nonmetallic minerals.  Beneficiation is the process whereby the extracted material is reduced to particles that can be separated into mineral and waste, the former suitable for further processing or direct use.  Beneficiation establishments are included in Sector 21, Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction.

"331","Primary Metal ManufacturingT","Industries in the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector smelt and/or refine ferrous and nonferrous metals from ore, pig, or scrap, using electrometallurgical and other process metallurgical techniques.  Establishments in this subsector also manufacture metal alloys and superalloys by introducing other chemical elements to pure metals.  The output of smelting and refining, usually in ingot form, is used in rolling, drawing, and extruding operations to make sheet, strip, bar, rod, or wire, and in molten form to make castings and other basic metal products.

Primary manufacturing of ferrous and nonferrous metals begins with ore or concentrate as the primary input.  Establishments manufacturing primary metals from ore and/or concentrate remain classified in the primary smelting, primary refining, or iron and steel mill industries regardless of the form of their output.  Establishments primarily engaged in secondary smelting and/or secondary refining recover ferrous and nonferrous metals from scrap and/or dross.  The output of the secondary smelting and/or secondary refining industries is limited to shapes such as ingot or billet that will be further processed.  Recovery of metals from scrap often occurs in establishments that are primarily engaged in activities, such as rolling, drawing, extruding, or similar processes.

Excluded from the Primary Metal Manufacturing subsector are establishments primarily engaged in manufacturing ferrous and nonferrous forgings (except ferrous forgings made in steel mills) and stampings.  Although forging, stamping, and casting are all methods used to make metal shapes, forging and stamping do not use molten metals and are included in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.

"333","Machinery ManufacturingT","Industries in the Machinery Manufacturing subsector create end products that apply mechanical force, for example, the application of gears and levers, to perform work.  Some important processes for the manufacture of machinery are forging, stamping, bending, forming, and machining that are used to shape individual pieces of metal.  Processes, such as welding and assembling are used to join separate parts together.  Although these processes are similar to those used in metal fabricating establishments, machinery manufacturing is different because it typically employs multiple metal forming processes in manufacturing the various parts of the machine.  Moreover, complex assembly operations are an inherent part of the production process.

In general, design considerations are very important in machinery production.  Establishments specialize in making machinery designed for particular applications.  Thus, design is considered to be part of the production process for the purpose of implementing NAICS.  The NAICS structure reflects this by defining industries and industry groups that make machinery for different applications.  A broad distinction exists between machinery that is generally used in a variety of industrial applications (i.e., general purpose machinery) and machinery that is designed to be used in a particular industry (i.e., special purpose machinery).  Three industry groups consist of special purpose machinery--Agriculture, Construction, and Mining Machinery Manufacturing; Industrial Machinery Manufacturing; and Commercial and Service Industry Machinery Manufacturing.  The other industry groups make general purpose machinery: Ventilation, Heating, Air-Conditioning, and Commercial Refrigeration Equipment Manufacturing; Metalworking Machinery Manufacturing; Engine, Turbine, and Power Transmission Equipment Manufacturing; and Other General Purpose Machinery Manufacturing.

"337","Furniture and Related Product ManufacturingT","Industries in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector make furniture and related articles, such as mattresses, window blinds, cabinets, and fixtures.  The processes used in the manufacture of furniture include the cutting, bending, molding, laminating, and assembly of such materials as wood, metal, glass, plastics, and rattan.  However, the production process for furniture is not solely bending metal, cutting and shaping wood, or extruding and molding plastics.  Design and fashion trends play an important part in the production of furniture.  The integrated design of the article for both esthetic and functional qualities is also a major part of the process of manufacturing furniture.  Design services may be performed by the furniture establishment's work force or may be purchased from industrial designers.

Furniture may be made of any material, but the most common ones used in North America are metal and wood.  Furniture manufacturing establishments may specialize in making articles primarily from one material.  Some of the equipment required to make a wooden table, for example, is different from that used to make a metal one.  However, furniture is usually made from several materials.  A wooden table might have metal brackets, and a wooden chair a fabric or plastics seat.  Therefore, in NAICS, furniture initially is classified based on the type of furniture (application for which it is designed) rather than the material used.  For example, an upholstered sofa is treated as household furniture, although it may also be used in hotels or offices.

When classifying furniture according to the component material from which it is made, furniture made from more than one material is classified based on the material used in the frame, or if there is no frame, the predominant component material.  Upholstered household furniture (excluding kitchen and dining room chairs with upholstered seats) is classified without regard to the frame material.  Kitchen or dining room chairs with upholstered seats are classified according to the frame material.

Furniture may be made on a stock or custom basis and may be shipped assembled or unassembled (i.e., knockdown).  The manufacture of furniture parts and frames is included in this subsector.

Some of the processes used in furniture manufacturing are similar to processes that are used in other segments of manufacturing.  For example, cutting and assembly occurs in the production of wood trusses that are classified in Subsector 321, Wood Product Manufacturing.  However, the multiple processes that distinguish wood furniture manufacturing from wood product manufacturing warrant inclusion of wooden furniture manufacturing in the Furniture and Related Product Manufacturing subsector.  Metal furniture manufacturing uses techniques that are also employed in the manufacturing of roll formed products classified in Subsector 332, Fabricated Metal Product Manufacturing.  The molding process for plastics furniture is similar to the molding of other plastics products.  However, plastics furniture producing establishments tend to specialize in furniture.

NAICS attempts to keep furniture manufacturing together, but there are notable exceptions: concrete, ceramic, or stone furniture; seating for transportation equipment; and specialized hospital furniture (e.g., hospital beds and operating tables).  These are classified in Subsector 327, Nonmetallic Mineral Product Manufacturing; Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing; and Subsector 339, Miscellaneous Manufacturing, respectively.

The processes for these products differ from each other, and the processes differ significantly from the fabrication processes used in making dolls or toys, the melting and shaping of precious metals to make jewelry, and the bending, forming, and assembly used in making medical products.

The industries in this subsector are defined by what is made rather than how it is made.  Although individual establishments might be appropriately classified elsewhere in the NAICS structure, for historical continuity, these product-based industries were maintained.  In most cases, no one process or material predominates for an industry.

"42","Wholesale TradeT","The Sector as a Whole

The Wholesale Trade sector comprises establishments engaged in wholesaling merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.  The merchandise described in this sector includes the outputs of agriculture, mining, manufacturing, and certain information industries, such as publishing.

The wholesaling process is an intermediate step in the distribution of merchandise.  Wholesalers are organized to sell or arrange the purchase or sale of (a) goods for resale (i.e., goods sold to other wholesalers or retailers), (b) capital or durable nonconsumer goods, and (c) raw and intermediate materials and supplies used in production.

Wholesalers sell merchandise to other businesses and normally operate from a warehouse or office.  These warehouses and offices are characterized by having little or no display of merchandise.  In addition, neither the design nor the location of the premises is intended to solicit walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers do not normally use advertising directed to the general public.  Customers are generally reached initially via telephone, in-person marketing, or by specialized advertising that may include Internet and other electronic means.  Follow-up orders are either vendor-initiated or client-initiated, generally based on previous sales, and typically exhibit strong ties between sellers and buyers.  In fact, transactions are often conducted between wholesalers and clients that have long-standing business relationships.

This sector comprises two main types of wholesalers: merchant wholesalers that sell goods on their own account and agents and brokers that arrange sales and purchases for others generally for a commission or fee.

(1)   Establishments that sell goods on their own account are known as wholesale merchants, distributors, jobbers, drop shippers, and import/export merchants.  Also included as wholesale merchants are sales offices and sales branches (but not retail stores) maintained by manufacturing, refining, or mining enterprises apart from their plants or mines for the purpose of marketing their products, and group purchasing organizations primarily purchasing and selling goods on their own account.  Merchant wholesale establishments typically maintain their own warehouse, where they receive and handle goods for their customers.  Goods are generally sold without transformation, but may include integral functions, such as sorting, packaging, labeling, and other marketing services.

(2)   Establishments arranging for the purchase or sale of goods owned by others or purchasing goods, generally on a commission basis are known as business-to-business electronic markets, agents and brokers, commission merchants, import/export agents and brokers, auction companies, group purchasing organizations (acting as agents), and manufacturers' representatives.  These establishments operate from offices and generally do not own or handle the goods they sell.

Some wholesale establishments may be connected with a single manufacturer and promote and sell the particular manufacturer's products to a wide range of other wholesalers or retailers.  Other wholesalers may be connected to a retail chain, or limited number of retail chains, and only provide a variety of products needed by that particular retail operation(s).  These wholesalers may obtain the products from a wide range of manufacturers.  Still other wholesalers may not take title to the goods, but act as agents and brokers for a commission.

Although, in general, wholesaling normally denotes sales in large volumes, durable nonconsumer goods may be sold in single units.  Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods used in the production of goods and services, such as farm machinery, medium- and heavy-duty trucks, and industrial machinery, are always included in wholesale trade.
"
"423","Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods","Industries in the Merchant Wholesalers, Durable Goods subsector sell capital or durable goods to other businesses.  Merchant wholesalers generally take title to the goods that they sell; in other words, they buy and sell goods on their own account.  Durable goods are new or used items generally with a normal life expectancy of three years or more.  Durable goods merchant wholesale trade establishments are engaged in wholesaling products, such as motor vehicles, furniture, construction materials, machinery and equipment (including household-type appliances), metals and minerals (except petroleum), sporting goods, toys and hobby goods, recyclable materials, and parts.

Agents and brokers primarily engaged in wholesaling durable goods, generally on a commission or fee basis, are classified in Subsector 425, Wholesale Trade Agents and Brokers.

"44-45","Retail TradeT","The Sector as a Whole

The Retail Trade sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in retailing merchandise, generally without transformation, and rendering services incidental to the sale of merchandise.

The retailing process is the final step in the distribution of merchandise; retailers are, therefore, organized to sell merchandise in small quantities to the general public.  Retail stores are fixed point-of-sale locations, located and designed to attract a high volume of walk-in customers.  In general, retail stores have extensive displays of merchandise and use mass-media advertising to attract customers.  Retailers often reach customers and market merchandise with methods other than, or in addition to, physical stores, such as Internet websites, the broadcasting of ""infomercials,"" the broadcasting and publishing of direct-response advertising, the publishing of paper and electronic catalogs, door-to-door solicitation, in-home demonstration, selling from portable stalls (street vendors, except food), and distribution through vending machines.  Establishments engaged in the direct sale and home delivery of products, such as home heating oil dealers and home delivery newspaper routes, are included here.

Retail establishments typically sell merchandise to the general public for personal or household consumption, but some also serve business and institutional clients.  These include office supply retailers, computer and software retailers, building materials dealers, plumbing supply retailers, and electrical supply retailers.

In addition to retailing merchandise, some retailers are also engaged in the provision of after-sales services, such as repair and installation.  For example, new automobile dealers, electronics and appliance retailers, and musical instrument and supplies retailers often provide repair services.  As a general rule, establishments engaged in retailing merchandise and providing after-sales services are classified in this sector.

Retail trade establishments are grouped into industries and industry groups typically based on one or more of the following criteria:

(a) The merchandise line or lines carried; for example, specialty retailers are distinguished from general-line retailers.

(b) The usual trade designation of the establishments.  This criterion applies in cases where a retailer is well recognized by the industry and the public, but difficult to define strictly in terms of merchandise lines carried; for example, pharmacies and department stores.

(c) Human resource requirements in terms of expertise; for example, the staff of an automobile dealer requires knowledge in financing, registering, and licensing issues that are not necessary in other retail industries.

The buying of goods for resale is a characteristic of retail trade establishments that particularly distinguishes them from establishments in the agriculture, manufacturing, and construction industries.  For example, farms that sell their products at or from the point of production are not classified in retail, but rather in agriculture.  Similarly, establishments that both manufacture and sell their products to the general public are not classified in retail, but rather in manufacturing.  However, establishments that engage in processing activities incidental to retailing are classified in retail.  This includes optical goods retailers that grind lenses, and meat and seafood retailers that process carcasses into cuts.

Wholesalers also engage in the buying of goods for resale, but they are not usually organized to serve the general public.  They typically operate from a warehouse or office, and neither the design nor the location of these premises is intended to solicit a high volume of walk-in traffic.  Wholesalers supply institutional, industrial, wholesale, and retail clients; their operations are, therefore, generally organized to purchase, sell, and deliver merchandise in larger quantities.  However, dealers of durable nonconsumer goods, such as farm machinery and heavy-duty trucks, are included in wholesale trade even if they often sell these products in single units.
"
"441","Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers","Industries in the Motor Vehicle and Parts Dealers subsector retail motor vehicles and parts.  Establishments in this subsector often operate from a showroom and/or an open lot where the vehicles are on display.  The display of vehicles and the related parts require little by way of display equipment.  The personnel generally include both the sales and sales support staff familiar with the requirements for registering and financing a vehicle as well as a staff of parts experts and mechanics trained to provide repair and maintenance services for the vehicles.  Specific industries included in this subsector identify the type of vehicle being retailed.

Sales of capital or durable nonconsumer goods, such as medium- and heavy-duty trucks, are always included in wholesale trade.

"48-49","Transportation and WarehousingT","The Sector as a Whole

The Transportation and Warehousing sector includes industries providing transportation of passengers and cargo, warehousing and storage for goods, scenic and sightseeing transportation, and support activities related to modes of transportation.  Establishments in these industries use transportation equipment or transportation-related facilities as a productive asset.  The type of equipment depends on the mode of transportation.  The modes of transportation are air, rail, water, road, and pipeline.

The Transportation and Warehousing sector distinguishes three basic types of activities: subsectors for each mode of transportation, a subsector for warehousing and storage, and a subsector for establishments providing support activities for transportation.  In addition, there are subsectors for establishments that provide passenger transportation for scenic and sightseeing purposes, postal services, and courier services.

A separate subsector for support activities is established in the sector because, first, support activities for transportation are inherently multimodal, such as freight transportation arrangement, or have multimodal aspects.  Secondly, there are production process similarities among the support activity industries.

One of the support activities identified in the Support Activities for Transportation subsector is the routine repair and maintenance of transportation equipment (e.g., aircraft at an airport, railroad rolling stock at a railroad terminal, or ships at a harbor or port facility).  Such establishments do not perform complete overhauling or rebuilding of transportation equipment (i.e., periodic restoration of transportation equipment to original design specifications) or transportation equipment conversion (i.e., major modification to systems).  An establishment that primarily performs factory (or shipyard) overhauls, rebuilding, or conversions of aircraft, railroad rolling stock, or ships is classified in Subsector 336, Transportation Equipment Manufacturing, according to the type of equipment.

Many of the establishments in this sector often operate on networks, with physical facilities, labor forces, and equipment spread over an extensive geographic area.

Warehousing establishments in this sector are distinguished from merchant wholesaling in that the warehouse establishments do not sell the goods.

Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in providing travel agent, travel arrangement, and reservation services that support transportation establishments, hotels, other businesses, and government agencies.  These establishments are classified in Sector 56, Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing rental and leasing of transportation equipment without operator are classified in Subsector 532, Rental and Leasing Services.  Establishments primarily engaged in providing medical care with transportation are classified in Sector 62, Health Care and Social Assistance.
"
"481","Air TransportationT","Industries in the Air Transportation subsector provide air transportation of passengers and/or cargo using aircraft, such as airplanes, helicopters, and spacecraft.  The subsector distinguishes scheduled from nonscheduled air transportation.  Scheduled air carriers fly regular routes on regular schedules and operate even if flights are only partially loaded.  Nonscheduled carriers often operate during nonpeak time slots at busy airports.  These establishments have more flexibility with respect to choice of airport, hours of operation, load factors, and similar operational characteristics.  Nonscheduled carriers provide chartered air transportation of passengers, cargo, or specialty flying services.  Specialty flying services establishments use general purpose aircraft to provide a variety of specialized flying services.

Scenic and sightseeing air transportation and air courier services are not included in this subsector but are included in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation, and in Subsector 492, Couriers and Messengers, respectively.  Although these activities may use aircraft, they are different from the activities included in air transportation.  Air sightseeing does not usually involve place-to-place transportation; the passenger's flight (e.g., balloon ride, aerial sightseeing) typically starts and ends at the same location.  Courier services (individual package or cargo delivery) include more than air transportation; road transportation is usually required to deliver the cargo to the intended recipient.

This distinction reflects differences in equipment used, type of load carried, scheduling, terminal, and other networking services.  General freight transportation establishments handle a wide variety of general commodities, generally palletized, and transported in a container or van trailer.  Specialized freight transportation is the transportation of cargo that, because of size, weight, shape, or other inherent characteristics, requires specialized equipment for transportation.

Each of these industry groups is further subdivided based on distance traveled.  Local trucking establishments primarily carry goods within a single metropolitan area and its adjacent nonurban areas.  Long-distance trucking establishments carry goods between metropolitan areas.

The Specialized Freight Trucking industry group includes a separate industry for Used Household and Office Goods Moving. The household and office goods movers are separated because of the substantial network of establishments that has developed to deal with local and long-distance moving and the associated storage.  In this area, the same establishment provides both local and long-distance services, while other specialized freight establishments generally limit their services to either local or long-distance hauling.

"51","InformationT","The Sector as a Whole

The Information sector comprises establishments engaged in the following processes: (a) producing and distributing information and cultural products, (b) providing the means to transmit or distribute these products as well as data or communications, and (c) processing data.

The main components of this sector are motion picture and sound recording industries; publishing industries, including software publishing; broadcasting and content providers; telecommunications industries; computing infrastructure providers, data processing, Web hosting, and related services; and Web search portals, libraries, archives, and other information services.

The unique characteristics of information and cultural products, and of the processes involved in their production and distribution, distinguish the Information sector from the goods-producing and service-producing sectors.  Some of these characteristics are:

1. Unlike traditional goods, an ''information or cultural product,'' such as an online newspaper or a television program, does not necessarily have tangible qualities, nor is it necessarily associated with a particular form.  A movie can be viewed at a movie theater or through television broadcast, video-on-demand, or streaming services.  A sound recording can be aired on radio, embedded in multimedia products, streamed, or sold at a record store.

2. Unlike traditional services, the delivery of these products does not require direct contact between the supplier and the consumer.

3. The value of these products to the consumer lies in their informational, educational, cultural, or entertainment content, not in the format in which they are distributed.  Most of these products are protected from unlawful reproduction by copyright laws. 

4. The intangible property aspect of information and cultural products makes the processes involved in their production and distribution very different from goods and services.  Only those possessing the rights to these works are authorized to reproduce, alter, improve, and distribute them.  Acquiring and using these rights often involves significant costs.  In addition, technology has revolutionized the distribution of these products.  It is possible to distribute them in a physical form, via broadcast, or online.

5. Distributors of information and cultural products can easily add value to the products they distribute.  For instance, broadcasters add advertising not contained in the original product.  This capacity means that unlike traditional goods distributors, they derive revenue not from sale of the distributed product to the final consumer, but from those who pay for the privilege of adding information to the original product.  Similarly, a directory and mailing list publisher can acquire the rights to thousands of previously published newspaper and periodical articles and add new value by providing search and software and organizing the information in a way that facilitates research and retrieval.  These products often command a much higher price than the original information.

Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in custom design of software; mass reproducing software or other prerecorded audio and video material on magnetic or optical media; producing live artistic and cultural works or productions; and performing in or creating artistic and cultural works or productions as independent (i.e., freelance) individuals.
"
"512","Motion Picture and Sound Recording IndustriesT","Industries in the Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries subsector group establishments involved in the production and distribution of motion pictures and sound recordings.  While producers and distributors of motion pictures and sound recordings issue works for sale as traditional publishers do, the processes are sufficiently different to warrant placing establishments engaged in these activities in a separate subsector.  Production is typically a complex process that involves several distinct types of establishments that are engaged in activities, such as contracting with performers, creating the film or sound content, and providing technical postproduction services.  Film distribution is often to exhibitors, such as theaters and broadcasters, rather than through the wholesale and retail distribution chain.  When the product is in a mass-produced form, NAICS treats production and distribution as the major economic activity as it does in the Publishing Industries subsector, rather than as a subsidiary activity to the manufacture of such products.

This subsector does not include establishments primarily engaged in the wholesale distribution of video and sound recordings, such as compact discs and audio tapes; these establishments are included in the Wholesale Trade sector.  Reproduction of video and sound recordings that is carried out separately from establishments engaged in production and distribution is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity.  Establishments that primarily acquire the rights to distribute video and sound recordings to the public via television or radio broadcast or streaming distribution services are classified in Subsector 516, Broadcasting and Content Providers.  Establishments using facilities and infrastructure that they operate to distribute cable and satellite television subscription programming are included in Subsector 517, Telecommunications.

"513","Publishing IndustriesT","Industries in the Publishing Industries subsector group establishments engaged in publishing newspapers, magazines, other periodicals, books, directories, and software.  In general, establishments known as publishers issue copies of works for which they usually possess copyright.  Works may be in one or more formats including print form, CD-ROM, proprietary electronic networks, or exclusively on the Internet.  Publishers may publish works originally created by others for which they have obtained the rights and/or works that they have created in-house.  Publishers may publish only and license rights to others to distribute their content, or they may publish and distribute content they create or own.  Software publishing is included here because the activity, creation of a copyrighted product and bringing it to market, is equivalent to the creation process for other types of intellectual products.

In NAICS, publishing--the reporting, writing, editing, and other processes that are required to create an edition of a newspaper, for example--is treated as a major economic activity in its own right, rather than as a subsidiary activity to a manufacturing activity, printing.  Thus, publishing is classified in the Information sector; whereas, printing is in the Manufacturing sector.  The Publishing Industries subsector excludes printed products, such as manifold business forms and appointment books, for which information is not the essential component.  Establishments producing these items are included in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities.

Reproduction of prepackaged software is treated in NAICS as a manufacturing activity, and custom design of software to client specifications is included in the Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services sector.  These distinctions arise because of the different ways that software is created, reproduced, and distributed.

Music publishers and establishments primarily engaged in the production, or production and distribution, of motion pictures and sound recordings are included in Subsector 512, Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries.  Establishments not engaged in publishing and exclusively obtaining rights from publishers to broadcast and distribute content are included in Subsector 516, Broadcasting and Content Providers.

Publishing establishments may create the works in-house, or contract for, purchase, or compile works that were originally created by others.  These works may be published in one or more formats, such as print and/or electronic form, including proprietary electronic networks or exclusively on the Internet.  Establishments in this industry may print, reproduce, or offer direct access to the works themselves or may arrange with others to carry out such functions.

"52","Finance and InsuranceT","The Sector as a Whole

The Finance and Insurance sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in financial transactions (transactions involving the creation, liquidation, or change in ownership of financial assets) and/or in facilitating financial transactions.  Three principal types of activities are identified:

1.  Raising funds by taking deposits and/or issuing securities and, in the process, incurring liabilities.  Establishments engaged in this activity use raised funds to acquire financial assets by making loans and/or purchasing securities.  Putting themselves at risk, they channel funds from lenders to borrowers and transform or repackage the funds with respect to maturity, scale, and risk.  This activity is known as financial intermediation.

2.  Pooling of risk by underwriting insurance and annuities.  Establishments engaged in this activity collect fees, insurance premiums, or annuity considerations; build up reserves; invest those reserves; and make contractual payments.  Fees are based on the expected incidence of the insured risk and the expected return on investment.

3.  Providing specialized services facilitating or supporting financial intermediation, insurance, and employee benefit programs.

In addition, monetary authorities charged with monetary control are included in this sector.

The subsectors, industry groups, and industries within the Finance and Insurance sector are defined on the basis of their unique production processes.  As with all industries, the production processes are distinguished by their use of specialized human resources and specialized physical capital.  In addition, the way in which these establishments acquire and allocate financial capital, their source of funds, and the use of those funds provides a third basis for distinguishing characteristics of the production process.  For instance, the production process in raising funds through deposit-taking is different from the process of raising funds in bond or money markets.  The process of making loans to individuals also requires different production processes than does the creation of investment pools or the underwriting of securities.

Most of the Finance and Insurance subsectors contain one or more industry groups of (1) intermediaries with similar patterns of raising and using funds and (2) establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, that type of financial or insurance intermediation.  Industries within this sector are defined in terms of activities for which a production process can be specified, and many of these activities are not exclusive to a particular type of financial institution.  To deal with the varied activities taking place within existing financial institutions, the approach is to split these institutions into components performing specialized services.  This requires defining the units engaged in providing those services and developing procedures that allow for their delineation.  These units are the equivalents for finance and insurance of the establishments defined for other industries.

The output of many financial services, as well as the inputs and the processes by which they are combined, cannot be observed at a single location and can only be defined at a higher level of the organizational structure of the enterprise.  Additionally, a number of independent activities that represent separate and distinct production processes may take place at a single location belonging to a multilocation financial firm.  Activities are more likely to be homogeneous with respect to production characteristics than are locations, at least in financial services.  The classification defines activities broadly enough that it can be used both by those classifying by location and by those employing a more top-down approach to the delineation of the establishment.

Establishments engaged in activities that facilitate, or are otherwise related to, the various types of intermediation are included in multiple subsectors, rather than in a separate subsector dedicated to services alone, because these services are performed by intermediaries, as well as by specialist establishments, and the extent to which the activity of the intermediaries can be separately identified is not clear.

Financial industries are extensive users of electronic means for facilitating the verification of financial balances, authorizing transactions, transferring funds to and from transactors' accounts, notifying banks (or credit card issuers) of the individual transactions, and providing daily summaries.  Since these transaction processing activities are integral to the production of finance and insurance services, establishments that principally provide a financial transaction processing service are classified in this sector, rather than in the data processing industry in the Information sector.

Legal entities that hold portfolios of assets on behalf of others are significant and data on them are required for a variety of purposes.  Thus, for NAICS, these funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles are the fifth subsector of the Finance and Insurance sector.  These entities earn interest, dividends, and other property income, but have little or no employment and no revenue from the sale of services.  Separate establishments and employees devoted to the management of funds are classified in Industry Group 5239, Other Financial Investment Activities.

"53","Real Estate and Rental and LeasingT","The Sector as a Whole

The Real Estate and Rental and Leasing sector comprises establishments primarily engaged in renting, leasing, or otherwise allowing the use of tangible or intangible assets, and establishments providing related services.  The major portion of this sector comprises establishments that rent, lease, or otherwise allow the use of their own assets by others.  The assets may be tangible, as is the case of real estate and equipment, or intangible, as is the case with patents and trademarks.

This sector also includes establishments primarily engaged in managing real estate for others, selling, renting, and/or buying real estate for others, and appraising real estate.  These activities are closely related to this sector's main activity, and from a production basis they are included here.  In addition, a substantial proportion of property management is self-performed by lessors.

The main components of this sector are the real estate lessors industries (including equity real estate investment trusts (REITs)); equipment lessors industries (including motor vehicles, computers, and consumer goods); and lessors of nonfinancial intangible assets (except copyrighted works).

Excluded from this sector are establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators.  Establishments renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in various subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction, agriculture).  These activities are excluded from this sector because the client is paying for the expertise and knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of heavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment.  Also excluded from this sector are mortgage REITs and establishments primarily engaged in managing the financial portfolio assets of REITs on a fee or commission basis.  These establishments are classified in Sector 52, Finance and Insurance.

The subsector includes two main types of establishments: (1) those that are engaged in renting consumer goods and equipment and (2) those that are engaged in leasing machinery and equipment often used for business operations.  The first type typically operates from a retail-like or storefront facility and maintains inventories of goods that are rented for short periods of time.  The latter type typically does not operate from retail-like locations or maintain inventories, and usually offers longer-term leases.  These establishments work directly with clients to enable them to acquire the use of equipment on a lease basis, or they work with equipment vendors or dealers to support the marketing of equipment to their customers under lease arrangements.  Equipment lessors generally structure lease contracts to meet the specialized needs of their clients and use their remarketing expertise to find other users for previously leased equipment.  Establishments that provide operating and capital (i.e., finance) leases are included in this subsector.

Establishments primarily engaged in leasing in combination with providing loans are classified in Sector 52, Finance and Insurance.  Establishments primarily engaged in leasing real property are classified in Subsector 531, Real Estate.  Establishments primarily engaged in renting or leasing equipment with operators are classified in various subsectors of NAICS depending on the nature of the services provided (e.g., transportation, construction, agriculture).  These activities are excluded from this subsector since the client is paying for the expertise and knowledge of the equipment operator, in addition to the rental of the equipment.  In many cases, such as the rental of heavy construction equipment, the operator is essential to operate the equipment.  Likewise, since the provision of crop harvesting services includes both the equipment and operator, it is included in Subsector 115, Support Activities for Agriculture and Forestry.

The Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services sector comprises establishments performing routine support activities for the day-to-day operations of other organizations.  These essential activities are often undertaken in-house by establishments in many sectors of the economy.

The administrative and management activities performed by establishments in this sector are typically on a contract or fee basis.

The processes employed in this sector (e.g., general management, personnel administration, clerical activities, cleaning activities) are often integral parts of the activities of establishments found in all sectors of the economy.  The establishments classified in this subsector have specialization in one or more of these activities and can, therefore, provide services to clients in a variety of industries and, in some cases, to households.  The individual industries of this subsector are defined on the basis of the particular process that they are engaged in and the particular services they provide.

Many of the activities in this subsector are ongoing routine support functions that businesses and organizations perform in-house.  However, it is common to contract or purchase services from businesses that specialize in such activities and can, therefore, provide the services more efficiently.

The industries in this subsector cannot be viewed as strictly ""support.""  The Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services industry group includes travel agents, tour operators, and providers of other travel arrangement services, such as hotel and restaurant reservations and arranging the purchase of tickets, serving many types of clients, including individual consumers.  This group was placed in this subsector because the services are often of the ""support"" nature (e.g., travel arrangement) to businesses and other organizations that purchase such services.

"61","Educational ServicesT","The Sector as a Whole

The Educational Services sector comprises establishments that provide instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects.  This instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities, and training centers.  These establishments may be privately owned and operated for profit or not for profit, or they may be publicly owned and operated.  They may also offer food and/or accommodation services to their students.

Educational services are usually delivered by teachers or instructors that explain, tell, demonstrate, supervise, and direct learning.  Instruction is imparted in diverse settings, such as educational institutions, the workplace, or the home, and through diverse means, such as correspondence, television, the Internet, or other electronic and distance-learning methods.  The training provided by these establishments may include the use of simulators and simulation methods.  It can be adapted to the particular needs of the students, for example sign language can replace verbal language for teaching students with hearing impairments.  All industries in the sector share this commonality of process, namely, labor inputs of instructors with the requisite subject matter expertise and teaching ability.
"
"611","Educational ServicesT","Industries in the Educational Services subsector provide instruction and training in a wide variety of subjects.  The instruction and training is provided by specialized establishments, such as schools, colleges, universities, and training centers.

The subsector is structured according to level and type of educational services.  Elementary and secondary schools, junior colleges, and colleges, universities, and professional schools correspond to a recognized series of formal levels of education designated by diplomas, associate degrees (including equivalent certificates), and degrees.  The remaining industry groups are based more on the type of instruction or training offered, and the levels are not always as formally defined.  The establishments are often highly specialized, many offering instruction in a very limited subject matter, for example ski lessons or one specific computer software application.  Within the subsector, the level and types of training that are required of the instructors and teachers vary depending on the industry.

Establishments that manage schools and other educational establishments on a contractual basis are classified in this subsector if they both manage the operation and provide the operating staff.  Such establishments are classified in the Educational Services subsector based on the type of facility managed and operated.

Excluded from this subsector are establishments primarily engaged in publishing educational software or other educational materials without providing instruction.  These establishments are classified in Subsector 513, Publishing Industries.  Establishments that manage schools and other educational establishments on a contract or fee basis without providing the operating staff are classified in Subsector 561, Administrative and Support Services.

"71","Arts, Entertainment, and RecreationT","The Sector as a Whole

The Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation sector includes a wide range of establishments that operate facilities or provide services to meet varied cultural, entertainment, and recreational interests of their patrons.  This sector comprises (1) establishments that are involved in producing, promoting, or participating in live performances, events, or exhibits intended for public viewing; (2) establishments that preserve and exhibit objects and sites of historical, cultural, or educational interest; and (3) establishments that operate facilities or provide services that enable patrons to participate in recreational activities or pursue amusement, hobby, and leisure-time interests.

Some establishments that provide cultural, entertainment, or recreational facilities and services are classified in other sectors.  Excluded from this sector are: (1) establishments that provide both accommodations and recreational facilities, such as hunting and fishing camps and resort and casino hotels, are classified in Subsector 721, Accommodation; (2) restaurants and night clubs that provide live entertainment in addition to the sale of food and beverages are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places; (3) motion picture theaters, libraries and archives, and publishers of newspapers, magazines, books, periodicals, and computer software are classified in Sector 51, Information; and (4) establishments using transportation equipment to provide recreational and entertainment services, such as those operating sightseeing buses, dinner cruises, or helicopter rides, are classified in Subsector 487, Scenic and Sightseeing Transportation.

"711","Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related IndustriesT","Industries in the Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector group establishments that produce or organize and promote live presentations involving the performances of actors and actresses, singers, dancers, musical groups and artists, athletes, and other entertainers, including independent (i.e., freelance) entertainers and the establishments that manage their careers.  The classification recognizes four basic processes: (1) producing (i.e., presenting) events; (2) organizing, managing, and/or promoting events; (3) managing and representing entertainers; and (4) providing the artistic, creative, and technical skills necessary to the production of these live events.  Also, this subsector contains four industries for performing arts companies.  Each is defined on the basis of the particular skills of the entertainers involved in the presentations.

The industry structure for this subsector makes a clear distinction between performing arts companies and performing artists (i.e., independent or freelance).  Although not unique to arts and entertainment, freelancing is a particularly important phenomenon in this Performing Arts, Spectator Sports, and Related Industries subsector.  Distinguishing this activity from the production activity is a meaningful process differentiation.  This approach, however, is difficult to implement in the case of musical groups (i.e., companies) and artists.  These establishments tend to be more loosely organized and it can be difficult to distinguish companies from freelancers.  For this reason, NAICS includes one industry that covers both musical groups and musical artists.

This subsector contains two industries for Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events, one for those that operate facilities and another for those that do not.  This is because there are significant differences in cost structures between those promoters that manage and provide the staff to operate facilities and those that do not.  In addition to promoters without facilities, other industries in this subsector include establishments that may operate without permanent facilities.  These types of establishments include performing arts companies; musical groups and artists; spectator sports; and independent (i.e., freelance) artists, writers, and performers.

Excluded from this subsector are nightclubs.  Some nightclubs promote live entertainment on a regular basis and it can be argued that they could be classified in Industry Group 7113, Promoters of Performing Arts, Sports, and Similar Events.  However, since most of these establishments function as any other drinking place when they do not promote entertainment and because most of their revenue is derived from sale of food and beverages, they are classified in Subsector 722, Food Services and Drinking Places.

These establishments also typically provide general or routine maintenance (i.e., servicing) on such products to ensure they work efficiently and to prevent breakdown and unnecessary repairs.

The NAICS structure for this subsector brings together most types of repair and maintenance establishments and categorizes them based on production processes (i.e., on the type of repair and maintenance activity performed, and the necessary skills, expertise, and processes that are found in different repair and maintenance establishments).  This NAICS classification does not delineate between repair services provided to businesses versus those that serve households.  Although some industries primarily serve either businesses or households, separation by class of customer is limited by the fact that many establishments serve both.  Establishments repairing computers and consumer electronics products are two examples of such overlap.

The Repair and Maintenance subsector does not include all establishments that do repair and maintenance.  For example, a substantial amount of repair is done by establishments that also manufacture machinery, equipment, and other goods.  These establishments are included in the Manufacturing sector in NAICS.  In addition, repair of transportation equipment is often provided by or based at transportation facilities, such as airports and seaports, and these activities are included in the Transportation and Warehousing sector.  A particularly unique situation exists with repair of buildings.  Plumbing, electrical installation and repair, painting and decorating, and other construction-related establishments are often involved in performing installation or other work on new construction as well as providing repair services on existing structures.  While some specialize in repair, it is difficult to distinguish between the two types and all are included in the Construction sector.

"92","Public AdministrationT","The Sector as a Whole

The Public Administration sector consists of establishments of federal, state, and local government agencies that administer, oversee, and manage public programs and have executive, legislative, or judicial authority over other institutions within a given area.  These agencies also set policy, create laws, adjudicate civil and criminal legal cases, and provide for public safety and for national defense.  In general, government establishments in the Public Administration sector oversee governmental programs and activities that are not performed by private establishments.  Establishments in this sector typically are engaged in the organization and financing of the production of public goods and services, most of which are provided for free or at prices that are not economically significant.

Government establishments also engage in a wide range of productive activities covering not only public goods and services but also individual goods and services similar to those produced in sectors typically identified with private-sector establishments.  In general, ownership is not a criterion for classification in NAICS.  Therefore, government establishments engaged in the production of private-sector-like goods and services should be classified in the same industry as private-sector establishments engaged in similar activities.

As a practical matter, it is difficult to identify separate establishment detail for many government agencies.  To the extent that separate establishment records are available, the administration of governmental programs is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration, while the operation of governmental programs is classified elsewhere in NAICS based on the activities performed.  For example, the governmental administrative authority for an airport is classified in Industry 92612, Regulation and Administration of Transportation Programs, while operating the airport is classified in Industry 48811, Airport Operations.  When separate records for multi-establishment companies are not available to distinguish between the administration of a governmental program and the operation of it, the establishment is classified in Sector 92, Public Administration.

Examples of government-provided goods and services that are classified in sectors other than Public Administration include: schools, classified in Sector 61, Educational Services; health care facilities, classified in Sector 62, Health Care and Social Assistance; establishments operating transportation facilities, classified in Sector 48-49, Transportation and Warehousing; the operation of utilities, classified in Sector 22, Utilities; and the Government Printing Office, classified in Subsector 323, Printing and Related Support Activities.
