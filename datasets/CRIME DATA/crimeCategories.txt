## PROMPT ##
I have a file csv which contains a list of crimes. Each crime has a code and a description.
I want you to read the entire list and find a possible categorization of crimes in sets, which can eventually also overlap each other.
Each set must have a title, a description, and the list of all the crimes that populate it.

An example could be:
- Violent Crimes
- Crimes which involve the use of brutal force, bare hands or weapons
- Crimes: 192, 261, 813, 901

## CATEGORY 1. Violent Crimes ##
